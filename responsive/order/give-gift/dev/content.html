      <h2>Our Furoshiki Gift Wrap</h2>
      <p>We travel all over the world for inspiration, and we always find so much beauty in other cultures. In Japan, we fell in love with furoshiki ("foo-roe-sh-kee")—a traditional wrapping cloth used to carry gifts or clothing.</p>
      <p>We love furoshiki as an elegant, versatile and earth-friendly way to wrap or transport a gift. It can even be re-used as a scarf, a kerchief, a headband, a cape!</p>
      <p>Since we don’t include prices on the packing slip, it can always be used as a gift receipt.</p>
      <p>Have you ever thought about wrapping gifts in something other than paper? During the winter holidays, 4 million tons of wrapping paper and shopping bags are thrown away. Wrap your gifts the eco-friendly way with our signature Furoshiki Gift
        Wrap, inspired by the artful Japanese tradition of wrapping gifts in beautiful swaths of cloth. Your giftee can re-use and repurpose the cloth gift wrap any time of year.</p>
