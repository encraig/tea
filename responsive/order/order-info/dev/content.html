    <h3>Accepted forms of payment</h3>
    <p>Orders on <a href="/">teacollection.com</a> can be made using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards</li>
      <li>Debit cards with Visa or MasterCard logos</li>
      <li>PayPal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Credit cards must be issued in the U.S.A.</p>

    <h3>Credit Card Authorization</h3>
    <p>Orders will be processed and shipped pending credit card authorization. When an order is placed, Tea will authorize your credit card to verify the funds are available. If you are using MasterCard or Visa, the authorization may appear as if
      you
      have been charged. With some card companies, the funds become unavailable after authorization. However, your account will not be charged until the order actually ships. If your order is canceled, the hold on the funds will be released and the
      funds will become available in less than a week or depending on the issuer of the card.</p>

    <h3>Search (And Shop)</h3>
    <p>On <a href="/">teacollection.com</a>, there are a bunch of ways to find what you're looking for. You may browse through our categories like Girls, Boys, Womens, Gifts and Sale. Within those categories, you can shop by category (like dresses,
      leggings or tees and tops). Plus, there are fun ways to shop by features like <a href="/girls-outfits">Outfits</a> and <a href="/boys-clothing-sets">Wardrobe Sets</a>.</p>

    <p>You can type a keyword, style number or description into our search box in the upper right hand corner of the page. Keywords will return any item that has that keyword in the name of the item or the description. Keywords are not
      case-sensitive,
      but they do need to be spelled correctly.</p>

    <h3>Price Adjustment Policy</h3>
    <p>Tea Collection is happy to provide a one-time price adjustment on items you’ve purchased if you see the item on our site offered for a lower price within 10 days of placing your order. We’ll completely refund the price difference to your
      original form of payment if we’re contacted within 2 days of your order date. A Tea Collection credit for the price difference will be issued if we’re contacted within 3-10 days. Please contact us at <a href="tel:8663748747">866.374.8747</a>
      or <a href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a>.
      Our Tea representatives are ready to assist you Monday through Friday, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Time.</p>

    <h3>Gift Wrap</h3>

    <p>Gift wrapping is included in the checkout options. We'll wrap your special gift in our furoshiki, inspired by the artful Japanese tradition of wrapping gifts in large, beautiful swaths of cloth. Your gift will be wrapped in a classic
      Japanese
      printed cloth, and we'll enclose a note card with your personal message.</p>

    <p>We also offer the option to purchase the gift wrap supplies. This provides flexibility if you want to buy gifts for multiple children on one order. Gift wrap service adds $8 to your order and gift wrap supplies adds $5.</p>

    <p>Learn how to use and reuse our <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/142307722?autoplay=1" title="The Art of Furoshiki" target="_blank">Furoshiki Wrap</a>.</p>

    <p>If your package is a gift but you do not wish to purchase gift packaging, you can send a complimentary gift message that will print on the packing list that is included with each order.</p>

    <p>Packing lists serve as gift receipts. (They don't include prices.)</p>

    <h3>Missing/ Damaged Merchandise</h3>

    <p>We apologize for any problems that may have occurred with your order. Please call 866.374.8747, between 6am and 6pm PST, or email at <a href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a> and we will assist you as quickly
      as

    <h3>Important Kentucky Sales And Use Tax Information</h3>

    <p>Tea Collection is not required to and does not collect Kentucky sales or use tax. Your purchase may be subject to Kentucky use tax unless the purchase is exempt from taxation in Kentucky. However, your purchase is not exempt merely because
      it
      is made over the internet. </p>

    <p>The Commonwealth of Kentucky requires Kentucky purchasers to report all purchases of tangible personal property or digital property that are not taxed by the retailer and pay use tax on those purchases unless exempt under Kentucky law. The
      tax
      may be reported and paid on the Kentucky individual income tax return or by filing a consumer use tax return with the Kentucky Department of Revenue.</p>
