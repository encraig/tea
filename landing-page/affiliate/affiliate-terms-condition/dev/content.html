  </ol>
  <h2>REVERSAL & COMMUNICATION POLICY</h2>
  <p>Tea Collection takes pride in our very low reversal rate, which we attribute to open communication with our affiliates. However, we reserve the right to reverse orders due to order cancellations, duplicate tracking, returns, disputed charges,
    and program violations as outlined in these terms and conditions.</p>
  <p>Additionally, if we ask you for clarification or more information on any orders or clicks that we suspect may be in violation of our terms and conditions, we expect that you will respond in a timely and honest manner. Below are violations of
    our communications policy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You are not forthcoming, intentionally vague or are found to be lying.</li>
    <li>You are not responsive within a reasonable time period and after multiple attempts to contact with information listed in your network profile. </li>
    <li>You cannot substantiate or validate the source of your traffic to our program with clear and demonstrable proof.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If any of the above apply, then we reserve the absolute right to reverse orders, set your commission to 0% or suspend you from the program for the period or orders in question. We know that many violations are a result of automated processes;
    however it is incumbent upon each affiliate to ensure that they have the appropriate checks and balances in place to pro-actively address these issues and adhere to our program rules.</p>
  <p>Any activities in violation of these terms shall be deemed a material breach of this agreement and may result in termination from the Tea Collection Affiliate Program.</p>
  <h2>COMMISSIONS</h2>
  <p>Tea Collection will pay affiliates a percentage of online net merchandise sales (after applying discounts and before adding taxes and shipping). Tea Collection does not pay a commission on gift certificates.</p>
