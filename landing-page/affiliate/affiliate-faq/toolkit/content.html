      {
        q: 'How does the Tea Collection Affiliate Program work?',
        a: 'After you join our program via ShareASale and are accepted as an affiliate of Tea Collection, you can place links via banners, text links and other creative assets on your website. When your visitors click through to the Tea Collection website via these links, that visitor is tracked until they place an order. When an order is placed by such a visitor, the order is associated with your website as the referring source and your ShareASale affiliate account is credited 8% of the entire order. At the end of each month, ShareASale sends you a check for the entire amount of revenue share you have earned in the previous month once you have reached a $50 threshold. Thus, the more visitors you refer to Tea Collection and the more of those visitors who turn into customers of Tea Collection, the more you get paid--and unlike many other websites, you get paid each time that customer places an order within 90 days, not just the first time!'
