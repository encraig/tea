    <h2>THE Global Fund for Children</h2>
    <p>Since 2003, we’ve partnered with the Global Fund for Children, a nonprofit dedicated to advocating for children and youth worldwide by developing grassroots organizations where they are needed most. A key to their empowerment? Community. The
      impact of these organizations show how crucial community-based programs are for uplifting kids in need of support.</p>

    <p>We’re proud to say that so far we’ve donated over $500,000 to help advance the dignity of children around the world.
